# Project_2-ETL

# Background:
In the ETL mini project, you'll collaborate with a partner to gain hands-on experience in constructing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. You'll leverage Python and Pandas, and you'll choose between Python dictionary methods or regular expressions for data extraction and transformation. Once the data is transformed, your task is to generate four CSV files. These CSV files will serve as the foundation for creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and defining a table schema. Ultimately, you will import the CSV data into a Postgres database.
